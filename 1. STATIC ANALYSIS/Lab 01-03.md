## Lab 01-03


## 1. Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to VirusTotal. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions?

**MD5:** `9c5c27494c28ed0b14853b346b113145`

**SHA-256:** `7983a582939924c70e3da2da80fd3352ebc90de7b8c4c427d484ff4f050f0aec`

Currently the virustotal gives the file score of 66/73.

## 2. Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so,what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.

- There’s only one library KERNEL32.dll with only two imports: **‘LoadLibraryA’** and **‘GetProcAddress’** which is a clear indicator that the file is packed.
- The section headers are not named, the raw sizes are equal to zero.
- The file info is **‘FSG v1.00 (Eng) -> dulek/xt.'** Browsing the internet in order to find something about it gives me information that this file is compressed. 

Browsing the internet shows that it cannot be unpacked without touching the file in debugger, so I will skip it for now.

## 3. Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?

Can’t tell that information at the moment without unpacking the file.

## 4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

Can’t tell that information at the moment without unpacking the file.
